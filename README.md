## Features
* Camera control: press and hold LMB in the viewport to control the camera with WASD (mind the layout) and mouse turns
* Creation and manipulation (highlighting, shift, rotation, deletion) of cube objects through the UI

## Disclaimer
I didn't know OpenGL when I started this project and was writing it in a sort of a rush. It could really do with major refactoring, but I would prefer to rewrite it from scratch, this time without any Qt-over-OpenGL wrappers.
